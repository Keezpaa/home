      content="My name is Kasper Iversen. I’m a norwegian IT-student at Høgskolen i Østfold (Halden) and in June 2023 I'll have a bachelors' degree in Software engineering and business intelligence . I'm looking forward to working with IT, and my goal is to pursue this passion within the field of software engineering, both back-end and front-end. In my free time I like working on projects and learning new things, I also like to do strength training, take my dog for a walk, be with my friends and take care of my family."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
